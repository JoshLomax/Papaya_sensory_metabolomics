   abstract = {Papaya (Carica papaya L.) is a globally popular tropical fruit that can either be used in an unripe, “mature green” state in savory dishes, or consumed when ripe and sweet. In recent years, commercial papaya growers in southern Florida have favored large-fruited accessions often destined for the mature green market. Increased cultivation of papayas for the dessert fruit market, especially varieties with superior fruit quality may facilitate growth of the industry. Therefore, a study was designed to identify varieties that perform well in southern Florida, as well as accessions possessing useful characteristics for future breeding work. A total of 21 papaya accessions were assessed for yield components, plant height, and ripe fruit quality traits with an emphasis on aroma. In general, small fruited solo-type papayas were among the tallest accessions at first harvest reaching up to 244 cm tall for ‘Kapoho #1’ and with first fruit insertion heights up to 152 cm for ‘Kapoho #2’. N08–75, ‘Sunrise #2’, and ‘Sunset’ had higher average fruit numbers (43, 45, and 37 fruit per plant, respectively) than some of the larger fruited accessions like Saipan Red #1 (7 fruit per plant) throughout a six-month harvest period. The accessions with the highest fruit weights ranged from 1.48 to 2.13 kg for Brash Panama, HAES 7836, N07–24, Saipan Red #1, and Saipan Red #2. There were significant differences among the accessions for fruit quality traits including pH (4.55–5.13), titratable acidity (0.10–0.23%), and total soluble solids (8.9–14.5%). Quantification of 112 putatively identified and 12 unknown volatile compounds revealed terpenes as the most abundant components in 18 accessions, with linalool typically at the highest concentration. Gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) revealed 26 volatiles that may contribute to aroma. Several of these compounds including butanoic acid, methyl butanoate, octanoic acid, and (E)-citral varied greatly in abundance among accessions. The variability observed for important fruit quality and agronomic traits suggests potential for improvement through plant breeding, as well as expanded cultivation of currently available varieties for the dessert fruit market in southern Florida.},

   abstract = {<p>Inconsistency in flavour is one of the major challenges to the Australian papaya industry. However, objectively measurable standards of the compound profiles that provide preferable taste and aroma, together with consumer acceptability, have not been set. In this study, three red-flesh papayas (i.e., ‘RB1’, ‘RB4’, and ‘Skybury’) and two yellow-flesh papayas (i.e., ‘1B’ and ‘H13’) were presented to a trained sensory panel and a consumer panel to assess sensory profiles and liking. The papaya samples were also examined for sugar components, total soluble solids, and 14 selected volatile compounds. Additionally, the expression patterns of 10 genes related to sweetness and volatile metabolism were assessed. In general, red papaya varieties had higher sugar content and tasted sweeter than yellow varieties, while yellow varieties had higher concentrations of citrus floral aroma volatiles and higher aroma intensity. Higher concentrations of glucose, linalool oxide, and terpinolene were significantly associated with decreased consumer liking. Significant differences were observed in the expression profiles of all the genes assessed among the selected papaya varieties. Of these, cpGPT2 and cpBGLU31 were positively correlated to glucose production and were expressed significantly higher in ‘1B’ than in ‘RB1’ or ‘Skybury’. These findings will assist in the strategic selective breeding for papaya to better match consumer and, hence, market demand.</p>},

   abstract = {Blueberry aroma is one of the most important quality traits that influences consumer purchasing decisions. This study aimed to optimize and validate a solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPME-GC/MS) method for the quantification of 73 volatile compounds in northern highbush blueberries. A SPME extraction of blueberries with water and specific proportions of sodium chloride, citric acid, and ascorbic acid, for 60 min at 50 °C using a divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) fiber was optimal. The method was validated for sensitivity, reproducibility, linearity, and accuracy, and used to quantify volatile compounds through matrix-matched calibration curves in six blueberry cultivars (‘Duke’, ‘Draper’, ‘Bluecrop’, ‘Calypso’, ‘Elliott’, and ‘Last Call’). Terpenes represented the most abundant volatile fraction, followed by aldehydes and alcohols. Linalool and 2-(E)-hexenal were key compounds that differentiated blueberry cultivars via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Enantiomeric analyses revealed an excess of (−)-limonene, (−)-α-pinene, and (+)-linalool for all cultivars with potential impacts on the blueberry aroma.},

   abstract = {Although they are staple foods in cuisines globally, many commercial fruit varieties have become progressively less flavorful over time. Due to the cost and difficulty associated with flavor phenotyping, breeding programs have long been challenged in selecting for this complex trait. To address this issue, we leveraged targeted metabolomics of diverse tomato and blueberry accessions and their corresponding consumer panel ratings to create statistical and machine learning models that can predict sensory perceptions of fruit flavor. Using these models, a breeding program can assess flavor ratings for a large number of genotypes, previously limited by the low throughput of consumer sensory panels. The ability to predict consumer ratings of liking, sweet, sour, umami, and flavor intensity was evaluated by a 10-fold cross-validation, and the accuracies of 18 different models were assessed. The prediction accuracies were high for most attributes and ranged from 0.87 for sourness intensity in blueberry using XGBoost to 0.46 for overall liking in tomato using linear regression. Further, the best-performing models were used to infer the flavor compounds (sugars, acids, and volatiles) that contribute most to each flavor attribute. We found that the variance decomposition of overall liking score estimates that 42% and 56% of the variance was explained by volatile organic compounds in tomato and blueberry, respectively. We expect that these models will enable an earlier incorporation of flavor as breeding targets and encourage selection and release of more flavorful fruit varieties.},

   abstract = {Consumer trends towards nutrient-rich foods are contributing to global increasing demand for tropical fruit. However, commercial cultivars in the breeding pipeline that are tailored to meet market demand are at risk of possessing reduced fruit flavour qualities. This stems from recurrent prioritised selection for superior agronomic traits and not fruit flavour, which may in turn reduce consumer satisfaction. There is realisation that fruit quality traits, inclusive of flavour, must be equally selected for; but currently, there are limited tools and resources available to select for fruit flavour traits, particularly in tropical fruit species. Although sugars, acids, and volatile organic compounds are known to define fruit flavour, the specific combinations of these, that result in defined consumer preferences, remain unknown for many tropical fruit species. To define and include fruit flavour preferences in selective breeding, it is vital to determine the metabolites that underpin them. Then, objective quantitative analysis may be implemented instead of solely relying on human sensory panels. This may lead to the development of selective genetic markers through integrated omics approaches that target biosynthetic pathways of flavour active compounds. In this review, we explore progress in the development of tools to be able to strategically define and select for consumer-preferred flavour profiles in the breeding of new cultivars of tropical fruit species.},
