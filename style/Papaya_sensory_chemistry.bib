  abstract = {The 5-year project `Breeding Roots, Tubers and Banana products for end user preferences' (RTBfoods) focused on collecting consumers' preferences on twelve food products to guide breeding programs. It involved multidisciplinary teams from Africa, Latin America, and Europe. Diverse data types were generated on preferred qualities of users (farmers, family and entrepreneurial processors, traders or retailers, and consumers). Country-based Target Product Profiles (TPP) were produced with a comprehensive market analysis, disaggregating gender's role and preferences, providing prioritised lists of traits for the development of new plant varieties. We describe the approach taken to create, in the RTB breeding databases, a centralised and meaningful open access to sensory information on food products and genotypes. Biochemical, instrumental textural, and sensory analysis data are then directly connected to the specific plant record while user survey data, bearing personal information, were analysed, anonymized, and uploaded in a repository. Names and descriptions of food quality traits were added into the Crop Ontology, along with the various methods of measurement used by the project, for labelling data in the databases. The development and application of Standard Operating Procedures, data templates and adapted trait ontologies improved the data quality and its format, enabling to link it to the studied plant material when uploaded in the breeding databases or in repositories. Some modifications to the database model were necessary to accommodate the food sensory traits and sensory panel trials. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: To better understand the effect of sugars and acid levels on perception of aroma volatiles, intensity of tomato earthy/medicinal/musty, green/grassy/viney, and fruity/floral aroma and flavor descriptors were evaluated using coarsely chopped partially deodorized tomato puree. This puree was spiked with 1.5\% to 3\% sugar (glucose/fructose combinations), 0.1\% to 0.2\% acid (citric/malic acid combinations), or water and 2 levels of 12 individual food-grade volatiles reported to contribute to tomato flavor. A panel consisting of 6 to 8 trained members rated 9 aroma, 8 taste, and 1 aftertaste descriptors of the spiked and nonspiked purees. The panelists detected significant differences (P{$\leq$} 0.1) for various individual aroma compound/sugar/acid combinations for a range of descriptors. Adding 0.2\% acids alone to bland tomato puree decreased green and floral aromas as well as sweet taste. Adding 3\% sugars alone increased green and musty aromas and decreased floral aroma as well as sour, citrus, and bitter tastes. Principal component analysis (PCA) explained 56.5\% of the variation in the first 3 principal components (PCs) for added acids and volatiles to bland tomato puree. The effect of added acids with the various aroma compounds generally increased perception of overall and ripe tomato taste and aroma, tropical aroma, and sour taste, and decreased sweet, fruity, and bitter tastes. PCA for added sugars with volatiles explained 67.8\% of the variation in first 3 PCs, and sugars generally decreased perception of sour, bitter, and citrus tastes and green aroma, while enhancing perception of flavors associated with ripe, tropical, and aromatic tomatoes. Adding sugars, acids, and volatiles together had a similar effect to addition of sugars alone.},

  abstract = {Papaya (Carica papaya L.) is a globally popular tropical fruit that can either be used in an unripe, ``mature green'' state in savory dishes, or consumed when ripe and sweet. In recent years, commercial papaya growers in southern Florida have favored large-fruited accessions often destined for the mature green market. Increased cultivation of papayas for the dessert fruit market, especially varieties with superior fruit quality may facilitate growth of the industry. Therefore, a study was designed to identify varieties that perform well in southern Florida, as well as accessions possessing useful characteristics for future breeding work. A total of 21 papaya accessions were assessed for yield components, plant height, and ripe fruit quality traits with an emphasis on aroma. In general, small fruited solo-type papayas were among the tallest accessions at first harvest reaching up to 244~cm tall for `Kapoho \#1' and with first fruit insertion heights up to 152~cm for `Kapoho \#2'. N08--75, `Sunrise \#2', and `Sunset' had higher average fruit numbers (43, 45, and 37 fruit per plant, respectively) than some of the larger fruited accessions like Saipan Red \#1 (7 fruit per plant) throughout a six-month harvest period. The accessions with the highest fruit weights ranged from 1.48 to 2.13~kg for Brash Panama, HAES 7836, N07--24, Saipan Red \#1, and Saipan Red \#2. There were significant differences among the accessions for fruit quality traits including pH (4.55--5.13), titratable acidity (0.10--0.23\%), and total soluble solids (8.9--14.5\%). Quantification of 112 putatively identified and 12 unknown volatile compounds revealed terpenes as the most abundant components in 18 accessions, with linalool typically at the highest concentration. Gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) revealed 26 volatiles that may contribute to aroma. Several of these compounds including butanoic acid, methyl butanoate, octanoic acid, and (E)-citral varied greatly in abundance among accessions. The variability observed for important fruit quality and agronomic traits suggests potential for improvement through plant breeding, as well as expanded cultivation of currently available varieties for the dessert fruit market in southern Florida.},

  abstract = {Significance             Consumers often regard heirloom fruit varieties grown in the garden as more flavorful than commercial varieties purchased at the grocery store. While plant breeders have historically focused on improving producer-orientated traits such as yield, consumer-oriented traits such as flavor have regularly been neglected. This is, in part, due to the difficulty associated with measuring the sensory perceptions of flavor. Here, we combine fruit chemical and consumer sensory panel information to train machine learning models that can predict how flavorful a fruit will be from its chemistry. By increasing the throughput of flavor evaluations, these models will help plant breeders to integrate flavor earlier in the breeding pipeline and aid in the design of varieties with exceptional flavor profiles.           ,              Although they are staple foods in cuisines globally, many commercial fruit varieties have become progressively less flavorful over time. Due to the cost and difficulty associated with flavor phenotyping, breeding programs have long been challenged in selecting for this complex trait. To address this issue, we leveraged targeted metabolomics of diverse tomato and blueberry accessions and their corresponding consumer panel ratings to create statistical and machine learning models that can predict sensory perceptions of fruit flavor. Using these models, a breeding program can assess flavor ratings for a large number of genotypes, previously limited by the low throughput of consumer sensory panels. The ability to predict consumer ratings of liking, sweet, sour, umami, and flavor intensity was evaluated by a 10-fold cross-validation, and the accuracies of 18 different models were assessed. The prediction accuracies were high for most attributes and ranged from 0.87 for sourness intensity in blueberry using XGBoost to 0.46 for overall liking in tomato using linear regression. Further, the best-performing models were used to infer the flavor compounds (sugars, acids, and volatiles) that contribute most to each flavor attribute. We found that the variance decomposition of overall liking score estimates that 42\% and 56\% of the variance was explained by volatile organic compounds in tomato and blueberry, respectively. We expect that these models will enable an earlier incorporation of flavor as breeding targets and encourage selection and release of more flavorful fruit varieties.},

Such ``exemplars'' can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called ``affinity propagation,'' which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time.},

Metabolic pathway analysis indicated that the formation of xanthophyll esters, due to substrate competition, resulted in a reduction of carotenoid-derived volatiles. Electronic nose (E-nose) analysis revealed that the key sensor W1C-associated volatiles had a green aroma, while W1S and W2S-associated volatiles showed a fruity aroma.

Volatile compounds at four different stages of fruit ripening were isolated from `Hong fei' variety by solvent assisted flavor evaporation, then analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In total, 38 different volatile compounds were identified, including terpenes, esters, lactones, ketones, alcohols, aldehydes, volatile acids, S- and N- containing compounds, and volatile phenols. The contents of terpenes, esters, lactones, ketones, volatile acids, and volatile phenols showed general upward trends and reached amximum at half yellow or full ripe stages, meanwhile most alcohols, aldehydes, S- and N-containing compounds showed downward trends with fruit ripening. The putative aroma biosynthesis genes were quantified by RT- qPCR, and the correlation analysis suggested that CpLIS1 and CpP450-2 could be responsible for linalool and linalool oxide biosynthesis, respectively; BITC biosynthesis could be regulated at post-transcriptional, post-translational or enzymatic levels, CpAAT1 and CpACX1 could catalyze the formation of some specific esters or lactones. This study offered important clues for further dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlining aroma synthesis in `Hong fei' during fruit ripening.},

However, commercial cultivars in the breeding pipeline that are tailored to meet market demand are at risk of possessing reduced fruit flavour qualities. This stems from recurrent prioritised selection for superior agronomic traits and not fruit flavour, which may in turn reduce consumer satisfaction. There is realisation that fruit quality traits, inclusive of flavour, must be equally selected for; but currently, there are limited tools and resources available to select for fruit flavour traits, particularly in tropical fruit species. Although sugars, acids, and volatile organic compounds are known to define fruit flavour, the specific combinations of these, that result in defined consumer preferences, remain unknown for many tropical fruit species. To define and include fruit flavour preferences in selective breeding, it is vital to determine the metabolites that underpin them. Then, objective quantitative analysis may be implemented instead of solely relying on human sensory panels. This may lead to the development of selective genetic markers through integrated omics approaches that target biosynthetic pathways of flavour active compounds. In this review, we explore progress in the development of tools to be able to strategically define and select for consumer-preferred flavour profiles in the breeding of new cultivars of tropical fruit species.},

Here we attempted to estimate the effects of {$\sim$}50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to finite population size (Ne = 100), the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},

  abstract = {Carbon captured through photosynthesis is transported, and sometimes stored in plants, as sugar. All organic compounds in plants trace to carbon from sugars, so sugar metabolism is highly regulated and integrated with development. Sugars stored by plants are important to humans as foods and as renewable feedstocks for industrial conversion to biofuels and biomaterials. For some purposes, sugars have advantages over polymers including starches, cellulose or storage lipids. This review considers progress and prospects in plant metabolic engineering for increased yield of endogenous sugars and for direct production of higher-value sugars and simple sugar derivatives. Opportunities are examined for enhancing export of sugars from leaves. Focus then turns to manipulation of sugar metabolism in sugar-storing sink organs such as fruits, sugarcane culms and sugarbeet tubers. Results from manipulation of suspected `limiting' enzymes indicate a need for clearer understanding of flux control mechanisms, to achieve enhanced levels of endogenous sugars in crops that are highly selected for this trait. Outcomes from in planta conversion to novel sugars and derivatives range from severe interference with plant development to field demonstration of crops accumulating higher-value sugars at high yields. The differences depend on underlying biological factors including the effects of the novel products on endogenous metabolism, and on biotechnological fine-tuning including developmental expression and compartmentation patterns. Ultimately, osmotic activity may limit the accumulation of sugars to yields below those achievable using polymers; but results indicate the potential for increases above current commercial sugar yields, through metabolic engineering underpinned by improved understanding of plant sugar metabolism.},

In this study, three red-flesh papayas (i.e., `RB1', `RB4', and `Skybury') and two yellow-flesh papayas (i.e., `1B' and `H13') were presented to a trained sensory panel and a consumer panel to assess sensory profiles and liking. The papaya samples were also examined for sugar components, total soluble solids, and 14 selected volatile compounds. Additionally, the expression patterns of 10 genes related to sweetness and volatile metabolism were assessed. In general, red papaya varieties had higher sugar content and tasted sweeter than yellow varieties, while yellow varieties had higher concentrations of citrus floral aroma volatiles and higher aroma intensity. Higher concentrations of glucose, linalool oxide, and terpinolene were significantly associated with decreased consumer liking. Significant differences were observed in the expression profiles of all the genes assessed among the selected papaya varieties. Of these, cpGPT2 and cpBGLU31 were positively correlated to glucose production and were expressed significantly higher in `1B' than in `RB1' or `Skybury'. These findings will assist in the strategic selective breeding for papaya to better match consumer and, hence, market demand.},

  abstract = {A major challenge to the papaya industry is inconsistency in fruit quality and, in particular, flavour, which is a complex trait that comprises taste perception in the mouth (sweetness, acidity, or bitterness) and aroma produced by several volatile compounds. Current commercial varieties vary greatly in their taste, likely due to historical prioritised selection for fruit appearance as well as large environmental effects. Therefore, it is important to better understand the genetic and biochemical mechanisms and biosynthesis pathways underpinning preferable flavour in order to select and breed for better tasting new commercial papaya varieties. As an initial step, objectively measurable standards of the compound profiles that provide papaya's taste and aroma, together with `mouth feel', are required. This review presents an overview of the approaches to characterise the flavour profiles of papaya through sugar component determination, volatile compound detection, sensory panel testing, as well as genomics-based studies to identify the papaya flavour.},
